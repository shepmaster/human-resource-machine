# Human Resource Machine

A little toy to parse [Human Resource Machine][hrm] save files and
then replay them.

You can see some [solutions I've created][my-solutions], but you
should buy the game and make your own, too!

## Usage

Clone the repo, then run it against your saved solution:

```
cargo run -- 01 my-solution-to-level-1.txt
```
